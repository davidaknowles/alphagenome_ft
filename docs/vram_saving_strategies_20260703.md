# VRAM Saving Strategies for Torch AlphaGenome Inference

This note summarizes successful inference-memory reductions tested on the
recreated merged Torch checkpoint:

`outputs/quant_ablation/recreated_e4v7bejy/merged_torch_default_lora_locon.safetensors`

All runs evaluate the human brain development ATAC head at resolution 128 on
the full valid/test splits. The peak-memory column is observed device memory
sampled with `nvidia-smi`, reported as GiB. Accuracy is reported as test
differential Pearson only.

The feature matrix columns are:

- **BF16**: aggressive bfloat16 Torch dtype policy.
- **Eff.**: precomputed effective standardized convolution weights.
- **Int8**: Triton int8 weight-only Conv1d.
- **NoInt**: 128bp-only encoder path that omits unused skip tensors.
- **Pool**: Triton max-pool without PyTorch's index/workspace allocation.
- **FEmb**: fused `encoder.dna_embedder.block`.
- **FD0**: fused `encoder.down_blocks.0`.
- **Flex**: FlexAttention replacement for `MHABlock`.
- **LRB**: low-resolution attention bias used by the FlexAttention path.

## Implementation Details

The main encoder-memory strategies are cumulative in the order below, except for
rows that omit one of the optional fused blocks. FlexAttention rows are side
branches on top of the Triton Conv1d baseline, because they change the
transformer attention path rather than the encoder/decoder memory path.

**Bfloat16 policy.** The `bf16_params` path uses the Torch model's aggressive
bfloat16 dtype policy for inference. This stores/casts floating-point model
state and persistent activations in `bfloat16` where the Torch implementation
supports it, while keeping integer inputs and indexing tensors unchanged.

**Effective standardized convolutions.** AlphaGenome's `StandardizedConv1d`
standardizes weights at every forward pass:

`w_eff = (w - mean(w)) * rsqrt(max(var(w) * fan_in, 1e-4)) * learned_scale`

For inference, `_stdconv_effective` precomputes this effective weight once and
replaces the module with `EffectiveConv1d`, preserving AlphaGenome SAME padding
but avoiding runtime standardization and making the layer eligible for the
Triton Conv1d path.

**Triton int8 weight-only Conv1d.** Eligible wide Conv1d layers are replaced by
a custom Triton kernel. Weights are quantized per output channel using symmetric
int8 storage:

`scale_c = max(abs(W_c)) / 127`, `qW_c = round(W_c / scale_c)`

The kernel dequantizes inside the matmul, accumulates in fp32 via `tl.dot`, and
stores outputs in the input activation dtype. Heads, adapters, LoRA/LoCon, and
other sensitive paths are skipped.

**No-intermediates encoder path.** For `resolutions=(128,)`, the decoder does
not consume the encoder U-Net skip tensors. The patched encoder therefore avoids
retaining those intermediate tensors during evaluation.

**Triton no-indices max-pool.** The encoder pool is `kernel_size=2, stride=2`.
The custom Triton pool loads the two candidate positions and stores only their
maximum, matching the ceil-length SAME behavior used by the local pooling layer.
This avoids PyTorch's hidden max-pool index/workspace allocation.

**Fused DNA embedder block.** `encoder.dna_embedder.block` is fused into one
Triton kernel:

`RMSBatchNorm -> JAX GELU -> int8 weight-only Conv1d`

The RMSBatchNorm part uses the stored running variance and affine parameters:

`x_norm = x * weight * rsqrt(running_var + eps) + bias`

The activation is AlphaGenome/JAX's approximate GELU, not PyTorch's default
erf GELU:

`gelu_jax(x) = x * sigmoid(1.702 * x)`

The fused kernel applies this activation before the int8 weight-only Conv1d and
does not materialize the normalized or activated full-resolution tensor.

This saves VRAM because the unfused path creates separate full-resolution
temporary tensors for normalization, activation, and convolution input. At
131 kb and batch size 32, these temporaries are large enough to drive allocator
reservation and observed peak memory. The fused kernel streams through the
operation and only stores the final block output.

**Fused down block 0.** `encoder.down_blocks.0` is wrapped with two fused
ConvBlocks and lean residual accumulation. In inference, the first block output
already has the expanded channel count, so the residual input is added in-place
into the leading input-channel slice instead of creating an explicit padded
residual tensor. The second residual add is also in-place.

This saves VRAM by avoiding both the ConvBlock temporaries described above and
the explicit padded residual tensor for the first channel-expanding down block.
The benefit appears mostly as lower reserved/observed device memory because the
peak allocator state is sensitive to high-resolution transient tensors.

**FlexAttention and low-res attention bias.** The `flex_mha` path replaces
AlphaGenome's Torch `MHABlock` forward method with PyTorch FlexAttention while
preserving the model's score transform:

`score = tanh((qk / sqrt(128) + bias) / 5) * 5`

before softmax. Queries and keys still use AlphaGenome RoPE, grouped-query
attention is enabled, and `RowAttentionBlock` remains eager. The `LRB` variant
patches `AttentionBiasBlock` so it returns the natural pairwise-resolution bias
tensor instead of the full repeated attention-resolution tensor. FlexAttention
then indexes this low-resolution bias inside `score_mod` with `q_idx // 16` and
`kv_idx // 16`, preserving the repeated-bias semantics while avoiding the large
materialized `B x 8 x S x S` bias tensor.

At 131 kb, the lowest-memory successful configuration was
`fused embed+down0`, reducing observed peak memory from 90.46 GiB to 24.59 GiB
relative to default. The best non-fused memory-efficient option was
`triton pool`, at 34.09 GiB with no visible test metric change versus the
Triton Conv1d baseline. FlexAttention did not reduce memory at this context
length and was slower than eager attention. Turning on all features tied the
lowest observed memory but further reduced throughput.

At 1 Mb, default inference exceeded 48 GiB. Plain bf16 params fit just under
48 GiB, while the Triton/no-intermediates family reduced memory substantially
further. The fused blocks primarily reduced observed/reserved memory at this
longer context length; they were useful for minimum VRAM but not for maximum
throughput. The low-res-bias FlexAttention path became useful at 1 Mb: it
avoided expanding the attention bias to the full repeated tensor, reduced
observed peak memory by about 12 GiB relative to the Triton Conv1d baseline, and
improved throughput by about 12%, with unchanged test differential Pearson at
displayed precision. The all-features row produced the lowest observed memory
at 11.58 GiB, with lower throughput than FlexAttention low-res bias alone but
still higher throughput than the fused embed+down0 row.

## Considered But Excluded

**Float8 and NF4 linear quantization.** `torchao_float8_linear` and
`bnb_nf4_weight_only_linear` are implemented in `scripts/run_quant_ablation.py`
and were benchmarked earlier, but they are not included in the recommended
stack. Linear-only float8 did not reduce actual device memory relative to
`bf16_params` in the physical-batch runs, and was slower at batch 20
(`11.50` examples/s vs `12.55` for `bf16_params`, both about `36.2` GiB).
NF4/NVFP4 linear and 1x1-conv quantization helped in small weight-focused
sweeps, but once the wide convolutions are handled by the Triton int8 Conv1d
path, the peak is dominated by activations, high-resolution convolution
temporaries, pooling workspace, and allocator reservation. In the matched
batch-32 combo run, adding NF4 linears/1x1 convs to the Triton-conv stack used
essentially the same observed memory (`43.62` GiB vs `43.61` GiB) with about a
`0.001` drop in test differential Pearson.

**FlexAttention.** A parity-preserving FlexAttention `MHABlock` replacement was
implemented as `flex_mha`, including the AlphaGenome score transform: additive
attention bias followed by tanh soft-cap before softmax. The low-res-bias
variant keeps the attention bias at the lower pairwise-resolution grid and
indexes it inside FlexAttention rather than materializing the full repeated
attention-bias tensor. Standalone parity was close, and full-model test
differential Pearson was unchanged at displayed precision. FlexAttention is
context-dependent: it did not help at 131 kb, but the low-res-bias variant was
useful at 1 Mb.
